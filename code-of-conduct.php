        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>This Code of Conduct is our way to encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior in our open source projects. We invite participation from many people to bring different perspectives to our projects. We will do our part to foster a welcoming and professional environment free of harassment. We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully during their involvement with this project.</p>

        <p>Participants may lose their good standing by engaging in misconduct. For example: insulting, threatening, or conveying unwelcome sexual content. We ask participants who observe conduct issues to report the incident directly to the Response Project at 
                        <SCRIPT type='text/javascript'>a = 'conduct';
                        b = 'flylang.org'
                        document.write('<A hre' + 'f="mai' + 'lto:' + a + '@' + b + '">');
                        document.write(a + '@' + b + '</a>');
                        </SCRIPT>. 
        We may remove harassers from this project.</p>

        <p>This code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies of the websites used to support this project. We acknowledge that participants may be subject to additional conduct terms based on their employment which may govern their online expressions.</p>

        <h3>Expected Behaviors</h3>

        <p>We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issues, pull requests, comments, emails, or chats) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is important that participants are attentive to their interaction style.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assume positive intent.</strong> We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people’s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect participants.</strong> We expect occasional disagreements. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then respectfully state if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.</li>
            <li><strong>Welcoming to new members.</strong> New members bring new perspectives. Some ask questions that have been addressed before. Kindly point to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once.</li>
            <li><strong>Be kind to beginners.</strong> Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider your impact on others.</strong> Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Use words carefully.</strong> We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Often, people will misinterpret sarcasm in online communications. We ask community members to communicate plainly.</li>
            <li><strong>Leave with class.</strong> When you wish to resign from participating in this project for any reason, you are free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly allows this. Your exit should not be dramatic or bitter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unacceptable Behaviors</h3>

        <p>Participants remain in good standing when they do not engage in misconduct or harassment (some examples follow). We do not list all forms of harassment, nor imply some forms of harassment are not worthy of action. Any participant who feels harassed or observes harassment, should report the incident to the Response Project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don’t be a bigot.</strong> Calling out project members by their identity or background in a negative or insulting manner. This includes, but is not limited to, slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes e.g. race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, national minority status, mental or physical ability.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t insult.</strong> Insulting remarks about a person’s lifestyle practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t dox.</strong> Revealing private information about other participants without explicit permission.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t intimidate.</strong> Threats of violence or intimidation of any project member.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t creep.</strong> Unwanted sexual attention or content unsuited for the subject of this project.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t inflame.</strong> We ask that victim of harassment not address their grievances in the public forum, as this often intensifies the problem. Report it, and let us address it off-line.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t disrupt.</strong> Sustained disruptions in a discussion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

        <p>If you experience or witness misconduct, or have any other concerns about the conduct of members of this project, please report it by contacting our Response Project at <SCRIPT type='text/javascript'>a = 'conduct';
                        b = 'flylang.org'
                        document.write('<A hre' + 'f="mai' + 'lto:' + a + '@' + b + '">');
                        document.write(a + '@' + b + '</a>');
                        </SCRIPT>
         who will handle your report with discretion. Your report should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your preferred contact information. We cannot process anonymous reports.</li>
            <li>Names (real or usernames) of those involved in the incident.</li>
            <li>Your account of what occurred, and if the incident is ongoing. Please provide links to or transcripts of the publicly available records, so that we can review it.</li>
            <li>Any additional information that may be helpful to achieve resolution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After a check, we will decide in order to warning, ban, or kick out from project. We will consider reports to be confidential for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.</p>
