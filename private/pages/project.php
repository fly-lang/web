            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Fly born in 2020 as an alternatives to the most important programming languages, with these main requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speed on running</li>
                <li>Easy to understand</li>
                <li>Quick for writing</li>
                <li>Powerful for all applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The guideline was: <br>
                <em>"This programming language don't has to do anything special but just make things simpler than others."</em><br>
                If you think your work is light you will feel like you are flying, so was taken all best things from the
                programming languages and was implemented into Fly.

            <h3>Top Features</h3>
            <p>These are some features taken from other languages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on LLVM: compiler backend optimized and exportable in multiple platforms.</li>
                <li>Multi-paradigm: Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming</li>
                <li>Duck Typing Inheritance</li>
                <li>Exception Handling without try-catch statement</li>
                <li>Native Aggregator Types</li>
                <li>Package import management based on namespace</li>
                <li>Open Source</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
