            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Fly was born in 2020 as an alternative to some of the most popular programming languages, with these main
                requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To be fast</li>
                <li>Easy to write and understand</li>
                <li>Good, memorable syntax that was quick to write</li>
                <li>To be powerful for all application</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Our guideline is that: "This programming language doesn't have to do anything special, but to just
                    make things simpler than others."</i>
            </p>
